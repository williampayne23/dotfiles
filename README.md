# Wills Dotfiles

Use stow `brew install stow` to install these. You need to be in the dotfiles directory which needs to be in the home directory (unless you configure stow)

All things you would put in .zshrc put in .zsh_local (there's probably a better way to do this with a normal .zshrc but sourcing a .zsh_wills_dotfiles I should sort later but busy now
